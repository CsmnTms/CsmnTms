# Hi, I’m Tămaș Cosmin

Professionally, I've been full‑stack developin' for 'bout half a decade. I'm doing that because I like solving problems, and at the moment, I'm doing my part in tackling those of the pharma industry.

Personally, I've been creating problems for 'bout three decades. Usually for myself. But I solve those too.
